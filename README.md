# Global Superstore Data Analysis 📊🌍

Welcome to the **Global Superstore Data Analysis** project! In this project, I worked with the **Global Superstore** dataset and performed data analysis using **Tableau**. The main objective was to provide clear and visually appealing insights into sales and profit data to help business decision-making.

## 📈 Project Overview

This project explores sales and profit trends from the **Global Superstore** dataset, which includes transactional data across multiple regions and product categories. Using Tableau, I created a variety of interactive visualisations to help better understand key business metrics, such as sales, profit margins and regional performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

In this project I made use of Tableau's powerful features to visualise and analyse the data:

- **Visualisations**: Created multiple visualisation types, such as bar charts, line graphs, maps and scatter plots to display the sales and profit data in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Marks**: Utilised marks to represent data points in a visually appealing way, with size, colour and shape to highlight key metrics.
- **Filters**: Applied filters to allow users to drill down into specific data, such as filtering by region, product category, or time period.
- **Calculated Fields**: Created custom calculations to generate new metrics like profit margins, sales growth and more.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Designed interactive dashboards by combining several visualisations for a more holistic view of the data.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Sales vs Profit Analysis**: I visualised the relationship between sales and profits, helping identify areas where high sales do not necessarily correspond to high profits.
- **Regional Performance**: Through a map visualisation, I compared sales and profits across different geographical regions to identify top-performing and underperforming areas.
- **Product Category Insights**: I analysed sales data by product category to uncover which categories contributed the most to overall revenue and profit.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Created visualisations to show how sales and profits evolved over time, highlighting seasonal trends and growth periods.

## 💡 Conclusion

This project helped me enhance my skills in data visualisation using Tableau. It provided valuable insights into the sales and profits of a global business, helping to identify key opportunities and areas of improvement. The ability to visualise and interact with large datasets in a meaningful way is crucial for data-driven decision-making, and Tableau provided the perfect tool for this.

By using a variety of charts, maps, and interactive features, I was able to deliver an engaging and comprehensive analysis of the dataset, showcasing the power of data visualisation in understanding business performance.
